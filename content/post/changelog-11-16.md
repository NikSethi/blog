Real question — what if CSS is the answer to all of my problems? I had a great time experimenting with updating the design for this blog, with help from Cursor to get me around the more annoying parts of trying to grok the structure of Hugo and theme details and everything. I don't know if I'm in love with the result right now, but I like it a lot more than what I was working with before. It feels a lot less default. Either way, it felt like generative, like time well-spent. It's much better than the scrolling I'd normally be doing on a Sunday night.

It's not just CSS actually. It's side projects where I can play around more with visuals in general. For a writing event that I want to host, I designed a little graphic using some of the different techniques I've been into lately (dithering mainly). The time spent doing something generative was super fun, and my little exports along the way are useful for telling a quick story about the iterative process here:

{{< figure src="/images/write-stuff.gif" target="_blank" >}}

I also have been looking into and brainstorming around doing some video stuff. I want to film and edit a video some time soon, and I have some loose ideas floating around about what to focus it on. There's something specific about how inconvenient video/film is as a creative medium. Mistakes are unforgiving, and there's so much prep at every step to prevent said mistakes. And such knowledge is paralyzing for someone who isn't very good at delivering in that medium even when things are good. But I will push through...
