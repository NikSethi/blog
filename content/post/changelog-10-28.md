I'm enjoying getting back into the nerdy parts of being an Online Person. I re-organized some of my website domains to make things less confusing. My world-famous website as a conversation is now at [conversation.niksethi.com](https://conversation.niksethi.com/) and my old index site now lives at the root of [niksethi.com](https://niksethi.com). None of this is super innovative, but it's nice to be creating a little world here. I personally can barely keep all of my sites straight, so getting to something a little bit more coherent is nice. 

In the future, I want to iterate on this blog to maybe loop into some webrings or RSS groups or something. There are so many cool people on the Indieweb and even just copying them would be a huge step forward in the way that I interact online. I'm soooo tired of the boringness of social media and the amount of control I can have over these spaces is liberating and exciting in ways that it wasn't a few years ago when I first made them. Twitter is fully dead to me, so these sites feel like they're actually replacing what was once there. 

What comes next? I think I'd like to fix Departures Board, make a little home for dithercam, and then iterate on the UX of this blog. Right now it's just a basic Hugo theme (Rocinante, I think), and that seems far too boring for the ideals that I have. Maybe I will build towards trying to win tiny site awards or whatever they're called. Who knows? All I know is that this is feeding my creative spirit.
